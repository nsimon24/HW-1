"Can you get them to roll a 6 more or less often than would be expected? How would you know - what is “more often”? 
-It is difficult to detect what can be labeled as "more often" considering how hard it is to get the probability. I ran the test around 60 times, the last 40 times using a tampered and altered form of a dice. The first 20 tries gave me a result of a 6 as frequently as the last 40 tries did. This has led me to believe that tampering with the dice can still result in similar results of receiving a 6. Therefore, the idea of "more or less often" does not seem to have any indication on the alteration of the dice. It seems to still have a probability of 1/6 or 0.16667 regardless of the state of the dice."

"Can you write some code in R that will simulate a fair roll?
dice = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6")
sample(x = dice, size = 20, replace = TRUE)"

> sample(x = dice, size = 20, replace = TRUE)

"Tell me something else interesting, that you learned from the data, for example about educational attainments in different neighborhoods in the city. Are there surprises for you?
 -I found that each neighborhood has a direct correlation to the educational attainments within the city. For instance, NYC has a mean of 0.3615 where those are educated. The borough with the majority is in Brooklyn with an average of 0.126 which is understandable since it is a largely populated area filled with many different incomes, mostly middle and lower class. I also found it interesting that an average of 0.1465 of New Yorkers rely on food stamps which is about 41% of people. I was mostly surpirsed that in regard to transportation, the highest average form of commute was car with 0.2997. It would be expected in NYC for people to heavily rely on public transportation such as the subway, rail, and/or bus for their daily commute."

"What is the mean return on days when the previous day’s return was positive? When the previous 2 days were positive? Negative? Now read about “hot hands fallacy” and tell if you think that helps investment strategy. 
- The mean return on days where the previous day's return was positive was -0.006308845 on 1/17/18. When the previous 2 days was positive, on 1/18/18 was also positive with a mean of 0.001559332. The "hot hands fallacy" does not help with investment strategy. This fallacy is based on expectations from the past and cannot be deemed reliable. False assumptions can be presented based on data that can change within another period. Investments must be judged through a series of events, history, and data. Just as this mean return has positive days and negative days, it cannot be a steady decision for an investor to make due to many factors that can alter a conclusion.
